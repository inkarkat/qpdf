# qpdf CLI extensions

_Additions and tweaks to the qpdf CLI._

These are some personal aliases, shortcuts, and extensions that make (my) work with the [qpdf](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf) content-preserving PDF document transformer easier and faster. Some of them may be specific to my environment and workflow, but maybe someone finds a valuable nugget in there.
